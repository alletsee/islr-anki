# ISLR-anki

This repository contains an Anki deck for the content of the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) (7th edition) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. The book is freely available on the authors' website and is popular among students who are looking for an overview of various statistical learning models.

To repeat and memorize the main content of the book, I have developed an Anki deck while reading the book. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is an open-source software for learning based on flashcards and spaced repetition.

**You can download the deck [here via AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1767251100) or [here directly from this repository](islr-anki-v1.apkg).**

This deck is *not* meant to replace reading the book. Rather, it is supposed to help repeating the main terms and core content of the chapters. It does *not* cover the conceptual and practical exercises from the book, which are typically longer, more detailed and require deeper thinking. I have created cards for elements that I considered relevant, but this is certainly a judgment call.

If you would like to suggest adding cards or found mistakes in existing cards, please open an issue in this repository.
